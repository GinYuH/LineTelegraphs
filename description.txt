Have you ever seen an enemy shoot a slow moving projectile at you and wonder "man, I wish this were more reactable!", well this mod is for you!

While enabled, all enemies and their projectiles will have a screen-sized line telegraph showcasing the direction they are currently moving, giving you plenty of time to move out of the way of the line and dodge! A no-hitter's best friend!

Comes with options to enable this effect for friendly NPCs/projectiles, use one color for all telegraphs, and adjust line length.


Note: When loading into worlds, the game will need to take time to load all of the telegraph colors, do not panic if the game freezes. Enabling red/yellow telegraphs will disable custom colors but remove this freeze if you can't bear with it.
